##Data Analysis and Preprocessing for RT_IOT2022 Dataset

## Overview
This Python script provides a comprehensive analysis and preprocessing of the 'RT_IOT2022' dataset. It includes operations such as data loading, preprocessing, univariate and bivariate analysis, feature encoding, and file management.

## Dependencies
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- shutil

## Execution
Run the script to perform the outlined data analysis and preprocessing steps on the 'RT_IOT2022.csv' dataset. Adjust the script as necessary for specific columns or data types.

## Script Features
- Data Preprocessing: Includes removing duplicates and checking for null values.
- Summary Statistics: Provides basic statistics for numerical and categorical features.
- Univariate Analysis: Includes histograms, boxplots, and bar plots for data visualization.
- Bivariate Analysis: Features correlation matrix calculation and visualization.
- Feature Encoding: Implements One-Hot and Label Encoding for categorical data.
- File Management: Handles saving and moving the processed data file.

## Assumptions and Exclusions
- The dataset is assumed to be stored as 'RT_IOT2022.csv'.
- The script does not include treatments such as removing outliers, handling imbalanced data, advanced feature engineering, and dimensionality reduction. These steps are not performed as the future use of the processed data is not specified. Decisions on such treatments should be based on the specific requirements of subsequent analysis or modeling tasks.

## Note
- The script is designed for exploratory data analysis and initial preprocessing. Further data treatments should be considered based on the intended use of the data in future analyses or model building.
